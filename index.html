<p>CloudEngine is an open source backend stack for building awesome mobile apps.
The aim of the project is to help mobile app developers get their apps off the ground
as quickly as possible. For this, CloudEngine needs to provide all the basic services
required for building rich mobile apps out-of-the-box. Currently there are bare minimum
services included. The aim is also to create fully customizable and extensible framework for
building backend mobile services. The core services could be tightly coupled.</p>

<a name="technical-overview" class="anchor" href="#technical-overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technical Overview</h1>

<p>CloudEngine is a pure Python django stack. Each backend service is plugged in as django
app. Each service should be independently pluggable and usable except the core services. 
Currently some of the services are tightly coupled. CloudEngine currently runs on gunicorn
server and hence runs only on UNIX environments. CloudEngine uses the excellent
<a href="https://github.com/abourget/gevent-socketio">gevent-socketio</a> library for implementing real time communication
channels, which are the basis of current push notifications system. 
gevent-socketio is the python port of the popular <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> library. 
For storage we use a combination of relational database (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and a
NoSQL db (Currently mongodb). Ideally, we'd like to move completely to a NoSQL db.
But we want to leverage a lot of django goodies and there is no elegant way to retain 
that while migrating to NoSQL. CloudEngine uses <a href="https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework">django-rest-framework</a> for providing
REST interfaces to services.</p>

<a name="client-libraries" class="anchor" href="#client-libraries"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Client libraries</h1>

<p>The aim of the project is also to provide readily available client libraries for 
as many different platforms as possible to make it easier to consume CloudEngine
services on mobile devices.
Currently only Android SDK is available at -  <a href="https://github.com/cloudengine/Android-SDK">https://github.com/cloudengine/Android-SDK</a>
We plan to add SDKs for more platforms </p>
