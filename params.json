{"name":"Cloudengine","tagline":"Open source backend for mobile","body":"Overview\r\n=========\r\n\r\nCloudEngine is an open source backend stack for building awesome mobile apps.\r\nThe aim of the project is to help mobile app developers get their apps off the ground\r\nas quickly as possible. For this, CloudEngine needs to provide all the basic services\r\nrequired for building rich mobile apps out-of-the-box. Currently there are bare minimum\r\nservices included. The aim is also to create fully customizable and extensible framework for\r\nbuilding backend mobile services. The core services could be tightly coupled.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Overview\r\n====================\r\n\r\nCloudEngine is a pure Python django stack. Each backend service is plugged in as django\r\napp. Each service should be independently pluggable and usable except the core services. \r\nCurrently some of the services are tightly coupled. CloudEngine currently runs on gunicorn\r\nserver and hence runs only on UNIX environments. CloudEngine uses the excellent\r\n[gevent-socketio][gevent-socketio] library for implementing real time communication\r\nchannels, which are the basis of current push notifications system. \r\ngevent-socketio is the python port of the popular [socket.io][socket.io] library. \r\nFor storage we use a combination of relational database (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and a\r\nNoSQL db (Currently mongodb). Ideally, we'd like to move completely to a NoSQL db.\r\nBut we want to leverage a lot of django goodies and there is no elegant way to retain \r\nthat while migrating to NoSQL. CloudEngine uses [django-rest-framework][django-rest] for providing\r\nREST interfaces to services.\r\n\r\n\r\nClient libraries\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is also to provide readily available client libraries for \r\nas many different platforms as possible to make it easier to consume CloudEngine\r\nservices on mobile devices.\r\nCurrently only Android SDK is available at -  [https://github.com/cloudengine/Android-SDK][android-sdk]\r\nWe plan to add SDKs for more platforms \r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation & Support\r\n========================\r\n\r\nComplete documentation is available at - ?\r\n\r\nFor discussions, questions and support use the [CloudEngine discussion group][group]\r\n\r\nor [Github issue tracking][issue-tracker]\r\n\r\nYou may also want to [follow the authors on twitter] [twitter]. \r\n\r\n\r\n[twitter]: https://twitter.com/thecloudengine\r\n[group]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cloudengine-dev\r\n[gevent-socketio]: https://github.com/abourget/gevent-socketio\r\n[socket.io]: http://socket.io\r\n[issue-tracker]: https://github.com/cloudengine/CloudEngine/issues\r\n[android-sdk]: https://github.com/cloudengine/Android-SDK\r\n[django-rest]: https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
